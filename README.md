# 💳 Credit Risk Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
End-to-end machine learning system for predicting loan default risk using XGBoost.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline (imputation, encoding, scaling)
- Imbalance handling using scale_pos_weight
- Model comparison (Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Threshold tuning for cost-sensitive decisions
- SHAP explainability
- Deployed using Streamlit

## 📊 Model Performance
- ROC-AUC: 0.745 (Compact deployment model)
- Handles imbalanced dataset (~8% default rate)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- External credit scores (EXT_SOURCE features) dominate predictions
- Income type and education significantly impact risk

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Streamlit
